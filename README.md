# Machine Learning 2020/21

We will tackle a classification task on the Fashion MNIST dataset by \cite{xiao2017/online}. Fashion MNIST is a dataset containing 10 classes of clothing items extracted from Zalando articles. The images are represented and structured in the same way as the original MNIST digit dataset, but they pose a greater challenge due to the clothing articles' complexity. We aim to analyze and showcase the performance of four different machine learning models on clothing article classification. 
The algorithms are support vector machines (SVM), random forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

## Requirements

Software versions specified have been tested.

- Python 3.8
- Numpy 1.19
- scikit-learn 0.24

## Dataset

The dataset is located under https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist on GitHub.
